   <p><b>1. VEHICLE LIFT</b></p>
    <p>Every mechanic needs to get under the vehicles to perform essential inspections and diagnostics. Your shop will need lifts to raise the vehicle to the height needed for these services.
    
    Match your needs to the various models and capacities of lift models. There are many characteristics that you need to consider. Including safety features, 2-post vs. 4-post construction, accessories, and power requirements.
    
    Be sure to buy lifts that are of high quality and name brand, to ensure availability of parts and service. Lifts are an important investment for your repair shop, as they're built to last many years.</p>

   <p>Many auto repairs will require raising vehicles at least temporarily. So a strong floor jack will be utilized on a regular basis.
